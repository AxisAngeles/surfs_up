### **Purpose**
As in most business, the **Surf and Ice cream shop** could be affected by a certain seasonality effect. 
Therefor, the main goal of the following analysis is to find out the temperature variation during June and December to begin understanding the possible sales impacts during high season.

#

## **Results**
To gather some meaningfull insights, we executed some statistical analyses with Hawaii's historical data to compare the average temperature between June, December and the rest of the year; including some other statistical indicators shown on the following chart:</br></br>

Based on the above, our main conclussions are:

1. On average, June's temperature is +2.5% higher than other months', but is not the hottest month of the year.
2. On the other hand, December's temperature is almost -3% colder compared to ohter months; but also, it is not the coldest.
3. As a result, June should be among the best months of Icecream sales, while December will probably underperform during these winter months.

#
## **Main Conclussion and Recommendations**
The shop will probably be affected by high season sales during hotter months like June; however icecream sales could decrease during December due to lower temperatures.
To further research this hypothesis, we recommend a couple of additional analyses:
* We should find out what are the hottest and coldest months to make a monthly forecast to start working on the financial analyses.
* We should also inspect the precipitation data to make sure the location is not affected constantly by weather conditions.
